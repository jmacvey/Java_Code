Addition and Removal of minimum Binary heaps may be done in a variety of ways. 

	 Addition is fairly simple:
		- Start at end of array
		- Iterate up the heap checkings parent position.  If parent is less than child, swap the parent with the child.
		- Otherwise we're done.

	 Removal is a bit more complex:
		- I laid it out keeping in mind basic structure of algorithms like MergeSort.  I let HeapSwap do the heavy duty work.
		- Many cases need to be checked.  Best to just look at the code to see for yourself.

Any questions, e-mail.
